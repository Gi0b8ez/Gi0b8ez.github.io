# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Giovanna Baez and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1, was one of my favorite labs because it was my first introduction to programming. Although it was an easy and minor program, it allowed me to get comfortable with the GitHub workflow and coding in general. I familiarized myself with how to clone a git repository from GitHub, commit changes, and push the changes back to GitHub. I also learned to check my source code for formatting and linting errors using the check_lint_and_format program. It excited me how much I learned and would continue to learn moving forward.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2, is another of my favorite labs because it was a challenging assignment that explored new concepts we had learned thus far. One of the challenges I faced was using I/O files in a program. Specifically for part 2 of lab 8, I learned how to use std::ofstream to create an output file stream to write to a file a secret message entered by the user. Furthermore, another challenge was reading a line of text. However, I understood how to use the std::getline function to read a full line of text into the std:string variable secret_message, which saved the input, the secret message. In the end, I enjoyed the learning opportunities it provided. 

* Lab 12 

    Lab 12, part 1, is my favorite lab because I was always curious about how an animated gradient GIF was created. I used trigonometric functions to build a look-up table and smoothly change the red and green channels like a sine wave. It was fascinating to see the result. I hope to continue to learn how to create more animations using C++.
